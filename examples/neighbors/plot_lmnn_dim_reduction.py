Dimensionality Reduction with Large Margin Nearest Neighbor
===========================================================

Sample usage of Large Margin Nearest Neighbor for dimensionality reduction.

This example compares different (linear) dimensionality reduction methods
applied on the Olivetti Faces data set. The data set contains ten different
images of each of 40 distinct persons. For some subjects, the images were
taken at different times, varying the lighting, facial expressions (open /
closed eyes, smiling / not smiling) and facial details (glasses / no glasses).
Each image of dimensions 64x64 is reduced to a two-dimensional data point.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) applied to this data identifies the
combination of attributes (principal components, or directions in the
feature space) that account for the most variance in the data. Here we
plot the different samples on the 2 first principal components.

Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) tries to identify attributes that
account for the most variance *between classes*. In particular,
LDA, in contrast to PCA, is a supervised method, using known class labels.

Large Margin Nearest Neighbor (LMNN) tries to find a feature space such that
the nearest neighbors classification accuracy is maximized. Like LDA, it is a
supervised method.

One can see that LMNN enforces a clustering of the data that is visually
meaningful even after the large dimensionality reduction.
